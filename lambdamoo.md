# Lambda MOO

Lambda MOO is an online community founded in 1990 by Pavel Curtis.  Based on the 1978-1980 work of Roy Trubshaw and Richard Bartle and their concept of a Multi User Dungeon (MUD).  LambdaMOO is designed to be a non-recreational and is developed using the MOO programming language.

It is a command-based environment where you interact with other people and objects in the world.  

The setting is the house of Pavel Curtis, you start in the coat closet.
