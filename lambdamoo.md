# Lambda MOO

Lambda MOO is an online community founded in 1990 by Pavel Curtis.
Based on the 1978-1980 work of Roy Trubshaw and Richard Bartle and
their concepts of a Multi User Dungeon (MUD).

It is a text and command-based environment where you interact with
other people and objects in the world.  Because it is a very
programmable environment, you can interact with many of the objects
and of course the bots and people lurking about.

The setting is the house, you start in the coat closet.
